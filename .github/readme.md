# Launcher

Launches the Oldschool Runescape client with the environment variables set.

For now it serves as a prototype for launching the client and see the "Play now" button, suggesting that the user has a token-based session.

## Running

The launcher generated from this project should be placed in the same folder containing `JagexLauncher.exe`. Simply run `launcher.exe` after this.
